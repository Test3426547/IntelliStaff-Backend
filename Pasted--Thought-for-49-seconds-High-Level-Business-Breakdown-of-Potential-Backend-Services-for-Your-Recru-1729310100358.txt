High-Level Business Breakdown of Potential Backend Services for Your Recruitment Platform
To provide a comprehensive and cohesive architecture for your recruitment platform, here's an expanded version of your initial high-level business breakdown. Each service is presented in the original sequence, with additional integrations, API endpoints, and considerations for best practices like using RabbitMQ, Sentry, and an API Gateway.

1. Job Data Ingestion Service
Functionality: Scrape job postings from external sources (e.g., LinkedIn), normalize the data, and store it in your database.

Key Components:

Web Scraper Module: Handles the scraping of job postings.
Data Normalization Processor: Cleans and structures the scraped data.
Database Interface: Stores the normalized data.
Integration with API Gateway: All external API calls pass through the API Gateway for security and monitoring.
Message Queue Integration (RabbitMQ): Publishes new job data to RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.
API Endpoints:

POST /jobs/ingest (Protected): Initiate the scraping of new job postings.
GET /jobs (Protected): Retrieve a list of ingested job data.
GET /jobs/{id} (Protected): Retrieve specific job data by ID.
Interactions:

Publishes: Job data to RabbitMQ for the Job Data Processing Service to consume.
Receives: Instructions or triggers from other services via RabbitMQ or RESTful APIs.
Logging and Monitoring: Integrates with Sentry for error tracking and Prometheus/Grafana for performance metrics.
2. Job Data Processing Service
Functionality: Optimize job postings using AI/ML and NLP to enhance keyword usage for better applicant matching.

Key Components:

ML/NLP Module: Processes job descriptions to extract and enhance keywords.
Keyword Optimization Engine: Adjusts job postings for optimal visibility.
Model Management Interface: Connects to the centralized ML Model Management Service.
Integration with Message Broker (RabbitMQ): Consumes job data from the queue.
API Endpoints:

POST /jobs/optimize (Protected): Accepts job data for processing and optimization.
GET /jobs/optimized (Protected): Retrieves a list of optimized job postings.
GET /jobs/optimized/{id} (Protected): Retrieves a specific optimized job posting.
Interactions:

Consumes: Job data from RabbitMQ published by the Job Data Ingestion Service.
Publishes: Optimized job data to RabbitMQ for the Job Relisting Service.
Utilizes: ML models from the ML Model Management Service via RESTful APIs or gRPC.
Logs: Errors and performance metrics to Sentry and Prometheus/Grafana.
3. Job Relisting Service
Functionality: Repost optimized job listings on platforms like Seek, ensuring maximum visibility.

Key Components:

Platform Integration Module: Interfaces with external job boards via the Integration Service.
Duplicate Detection: Checks to prevent duplicate postings.
Scheduling System: Manages timing for reposting and updates.
API Gateway Integration: All outgoing API calls are routed through the Integration Service and API Gateway.
API Endpoints:

POST /jobs/relist (Protected): Initiates the reposting process for optimized jobs.
GET /jobs/relist/status (Protected): Retrieves status updates on relisted jobs.
GET /jobs/relist/{id} (Protected): Retrieves status and details for a specific relisted job.
Interactions:

Consumes: Optimized job data from RabbitMQ.
Communicates: With external job boards via the Integration Service.
Publishes: Relisting statuses to the Notification Service via RabbitMQ.
Logs: Activities and errors to Sentry and performance metrics to Prometheus/Grafana.
